# MSM GUI

It's time to add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on top of our APIs.

First, read through the code that we're starting with. A good sequence to read through is always:

 - `config/routes.rb` — get a sense of the API (the surface) of the application
 - `app/models/` — get a sense of the tables and business logic (the heart) of the application
 - `app/controllers` — see how they tie together

Think of at least one question to ask.

## Standard Workflow

 1. Add dummy data to your database: `rails dev:prime`
 1. Start the web server by running `bin/server`.
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Make new branches freely to experiment! _Especially_ before starting on a new task.
